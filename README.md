# "The Curse of the Django Podast"

Elena Williams<br>
Talk for PyConAU 2014 scheduled for 2nd Aug 2014

#### Abstract:

The Django community is full of amazing, enthusiastic and multi-talented individuals who love to take on exciting new extra-curricular projects in their massive amounts of spare time.

A Django podcast is an excellent example of this kind of project and it is one that has been taken up no less than 5 times so far.

I am the latest to take up this torch.

This has so far been an amazing, educational, exhilarating experience: I have had the honour of gathering the thoughts of some of the best, brightest and most prolific in our community. It's been a load of work but also a load of fun.

Come hear the story of how this has happened, and come to learn how you can be part of the greater Django information and communication machinery.
